# Combat

Combat is chaotic and brutal. Each passing round brings combatants closer to death, and players could be faced with two rounds of enemy attacks in a row. 

Do not wade into a horde of enemies and expect victory. Gather information, bring more than weapons, set traps and ambushes, or avoid fights entirely whenever possible.

## Initiative

Roll a d6 at the start of each round:

* **1-3** the Player Characters act first
* **4-6** the enemies act first

If one side catches the other unaware, they automatically act first.

Characters on each side can perform actions and moves in any order. You may prefer to set an order to keep rounds organized, such as going clockwise around the table, or from top to bottom in a group call. Always allow players to act together if they choose so they can easily collaborate with their actions. 

## Actions

On their turn a PC can move Nearby and take 1 Action.

These are the most common Actions in combat:

**Attack**: roll the weapon’s damage die and subtract the foe’s AV. The remainder is taken as damage.

**Defend**: all Attacks against you have 1 Bane.

**Move**: Make an additional move Nearby.

**Use an Item**: as per the item’s description.

**Maneuver**:  disarming, pushing, tripping, climbing on, restraining etc. Make an appropriate save against the enemy’s Target. See Conditions for effects.

**Cast a Spell**:  See spell rules *(under construction, link this later)*

## Crits

When you roll the max value on a damage die, the die explodes! This means you roll an additional die of the same type. This die can also explode. An attack can only explode as many times as the number of slots the weapon used takes up. Use the table below as a guide:
- Light weapons, 1 slot: Max 1 damage die, 1 crit die
- Medium weapons, 2 slots: Max 1 damage die, 2 crit die
- Heavy weapons, 3 slots: Max 1 damage die, 3 crit die

## Fumbles

When you roll a 1 on the damage dice, mark Usage on the weapon.

## Sneak Attacks

* Attacks deal 1 extra damage die of the same type as the weapon
* This extra dice can crit
* A truly defenseless creature is killed outright

## Morale Saves

* PC can test the enemies’ morale when they are at a breaking point
    * Ex. Half the enemies are defeated, their leader is defeated, they are ambushed, etc.
* Morale saves use a PC’s WIL vs. the current enemy leader’s Target
* **Success**: enemies flee or surrender
* **Failure**: PCs must wait for a different breaking point to try again

## Damage and Wounds

### Armor Value

**Armor Value** (AV) is granted by armor and shields and reduces damage before it is taken to Stamina, or as Wounds.

**Direct**-**damage** ignores AV. It comes from sources which worn armor would not protect from, such as poison, falling, suffocating, etc.

### Stamina

Stamina represents the skill and determination a PC has gained by adventuring to avoid lethal wounds. **Damage taken is subtracted from Stamina first**. These are near misses and scrapes that are easily healed.

### Wounds

After Stamina reaches 0, each point of damage is added to your **Wounds**. Wounds represent real, debilitating harm that is hard to walk off.

The number of wounds taken from a single damage source or attack determines any additional effects the victim suffers:

|Wounds|Effect|
|------|--------------------|
|1-3|Just pain and blood|
|4-6|Damaged gear: Roll d20, mark 1d4 Usage on the item in that numbered slot|
|7-9|Bleeding out (see Conditions)|
|10+|Mortal Wound: You will die in 1d4 rounds unless healed at least 1 wound| 

**Once a PC's Wounds reaches their Max Wounds, they die.**
