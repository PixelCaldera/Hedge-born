# Conditions

Characters can inflict conditions by using items, performing manuevers, and engaging with their environment. There enemies will be doing the same.

**Bleeding out:** each round, take 1 wound.

**Ensnared:** cannot move, can still use actions provided there is enough space for it.

**Hobbled:** Moving Nearby requires spending an Action.

**On Fire:** each round, take 1d4 damage and Mark 1 Usage on flammable worn and held items, and flammable items in your quick slots.

**Poisoned:** each round, take 1d6 damage, then make an END save. On a success, you are no longer poisoned.

**Prone:** Moving Nearby requires spending an Action. 1 boon on melee attacks against you.

This list isn't exhaustive, but should give the Referee an idea of how to rule other long lasting effects that come up. Referees should make note of other conditions they come up with so it can be ruled the same way in the future.

## Ending Conditions

Conditions aren't permanent. They end when:
- An action is spent removing the source of the condition (standing from prone, pulling a caltrop out of your foot, escaping an oppenent's grasp, rolling around to put out flames, etc.)
  - Risky or painful actions require a Save. The Referee should select the ability based on the player's methods
  - If a save is failed, consider having the character succeed but take more damage, rather than prolonging the condition. Being stuck trying to pull open a beartrap isn't fun.
- An item is used to heal the condition (A Healer's kit to cure poison or stop a bleeding wound, or a lit torch to cauterize in a pinch, etc.)
  - Requires an action to perform, and 1 Usage of the item
- Combat has ended. When there's no nearby threats, most conditions are trivial enough to deal with that it does not require detailed actions or saves
  - Bleeding and Poison are exceptions, they can still kill after combat has ended. Stay in Rounds until those condition are dealt with
- You die.
