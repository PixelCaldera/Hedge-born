## Levelling Up

When your PC gains a new level:
1. Add +1 to two different ability scores of your choice. Abilities cannot exceed +10
    - If STR is increased, increase Max Item Slots
    - If DEX is increased, increase Quick Slots
    - IF END is increased, increase Max Wounds
    - if WIL is increased, increase Memory
2. Roll a number of d6s equal to your new level to find your new Stamina maximum. If the result is less than your previous maximum, your maximum Stamina increases by 1
3. Review your Traits, decide if any of them have changed from your experiences
