# How to Play
Playing Hedge-born can be broken down into these steps:
1. The Referee describes the situation
2. The Players describe how they interact with the situation
3. The Referee determines if the player’s actions are successful, dice are rolled if necessary, and the Referee describes the results.

This structure repeats as the game continues. 

While interacting, Player Characters (PCs) can Move and perform one Action, before moving on to what the next Player would like to do. 

## Tracking Time
The steps above are tracked depending on the urgency of the situation using these time scales:

**Rounds**
- Used in combat, chases, complex traps, or otherwise when every second counts
- Roughly 6 seconds of in-game time

**Turns**
- Used when exploring dungeons, or anywhere where danger could be lurking just around the corner
- About 10 minutes of in-game time
- There are 6 Turns in an hour

**Watches**
- Used for long-distance travel or exploring a settlement, where there are lengthy periods without incident
- 6 hours of in-game time
- There are 4 watches in a day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, and Night)


Actions, items, and spells will reference these time scales to describe how long they takes to perform.

## Measuring Distance
To measure the positions and movement of characters and objects in the world, four range bands are used. From nearest to farthest:

Close → Nearby → Far → Distant

### Movement
Moving shifts you one step along the range band.

On a Turn, a PC can move somewhere Nearby. If a PC is Nearby something and decides to move towards it, they are now Close to it.

An action can also be spent moving, allowing a character to move 2 steps along the range band in one turn, or somewhere Far.

When movement is hindered by the environment or enemies, movement shifts only half a step along the range band, which means moving somewhere Nearby takes 2 Turns.

### Interaction
If a PC is Close to something, that means they are able to physically interact with it Ex. picking up an object, attacking a creature with a melee weapon. Ranged weapons, Items, and Spells have specified ranges that determine their interaction distance.

### Zones
Zones are used in combat to better visualize areas. The surroundings are broken up into distinct zones. Everything inside a Zone is Close to each other, things in the next Zone over are Nearby, things two Zones over are Far, etc. 

## Saves
When a situation becomes risky for a PC, they must make a save to try and avoid danger.

**To make a save:** Players roll a d20 and add their Ability Score. If the result is greater than or equal to the Difficulty Rating, they succeed.

Saves are made against a Difficulty Rating (DR):
- The standard difficulty rating is 16
  - Used for environmental hazards and obstacles
  - If this seems too high, consider if a save is even necessary (see Time and Gear)
- When making a save against another creature, use their DR
  - this is calculated as 11 + the creature's level, and listed on their stat block

  The DR is not secret. The Referee should always share the DR before a save is made. 

The type of ability used depends on the kind of threat the PC is facing: 

**Strength (STR):**
- Bending bars and lifting gates
- Kicking down doors
- Shoving and grappling

**Endurance (END):**
- Resisting poison and diseases
- Going long periods without eating or resting

**Dexterity (DEX):**
- Dodging traps
- Keeping your balance
- Fleeing danger
- Picking Locks
- Moving Quietly

**Willpower (WIL):**
- Staying calm
- Resisting magic charms and illusions
- Persuading and deceiving

### Time and Gear
The necessity and risk of making a save is dependent on the time and gear at hand.
- If you have both time and gear, you succeed. No save is required.
  - Ex. hammering spikes into a door frame to block it while no one else is around to stop you
- If you have neither time or gear, a save is certainly required and consequences could be severe
  - Ex. Trying to kick down a locked door while a guard chases after you. Should you fail the roll, you may hurt your foot and the guard will get closer to catching you
- If you have either time or gear, a save will probably be required, but consequences are mitigated
  - Ex. Using lockpicks to open a locked door while a guard chases after you. You have gear but limited time. Should you fail the DEX save, only time is wasted and the guard catches up to you
  - Ex. Trying to kick down a locked door while no one is around. You have time but no gear. Should you fail the STR save, the noise of the door breaking may draw unwanted attention

### Boons and Banes
Using a resource to aid in making a save or attack can grant Boons:
- For each Boon on a save or attack, roll 1d4 and add to the total
- Gain Boons by using the right items, spells, Background knowledge, aid from another character etc.

Interference not initially related to the save or attack can apply Banes:
- For each Bane on a save or attack, roll 1d4 and subtract from the total 
- Banes come from NPC or monster interference, a condition, a limitation from equipment, etc.

**Boons and Banes cancel each other out before rolls are made.**
- Ex. If a PC has 2 Boons and a Bane, the Bane cancels out 1 of the Boons,  only 1d4 is rolled and added to the total.

## Luck Dice
Each luck dice spent grants 1d6 to roll. The result can be used to:
- Add to a save
- Add to the results of an action (damage, spell effect, etc.)
- Reduce 1 source of damage by total

Players can spend as many luck dice as they want on a single action.

Characters gain luck dice at the end of a session. See **Ending the Session** for more details.

PCs can have a maximum of 6 Luck Dice at once.

### Testing Luck
To test Luck roll 1d6. If the number on the die is less than or equal to your current Luck Dice, the circumstances are in your favor.

If a situation will affect a group of PCs, use the lowest Luck Dice total among them.

### Out of Luck
When a PC reaches 0 Luck dice, a Doom occurs. Dooms are unforseen consequences that would make a character say "just my luck." Referees can use the examples below or come up with their own. 
- For luck dice spent on a save:
  - the obstacle is removed, but enemies are waiting just beyond
  - an item used to make the save is destroyed or severely damaged
  - a character becomes seperated and surrounded by threats
- For luck dice spent on attacks:
  - The surroundings are damaged by the attack, the room is now collapsing, on fire, filling with gas, plunged in darkness etc.
  - The noise attracts other enemies, roll for a random encounter, they can be heard approaching
  - The weapon used is thrown somewhere hazardous to reach
- For luck dice spent on magic:
  - The spell goes haywire, roll for a Mishap (see Magic)
- Other situations:
  - An NPC the characters were avoiding shows up
  - The character's mental wellbeing is strained. Have them make a WIL save, on a success they gain a perturbed trait (sunken eyes, nail biting, hand tremors), on a failure they gain an insanity
    - maybe make a table for these perturbed traits?

After a Doom occurs, the out of luck PC gains 2 Luck Dice.

**Dooms never negate a successful roll or attack, nor should they immediately kill a PC. They occur after the action the luck dice were spent on, and rachet up the tension, placing characters in difficult situations.**

*Author's Note: Dooms should be as immediate as possible. Too many times I've waited after all luck dice have been spent for the right moment to doom the characters, only for the session to come to an end, and the characters gain more luck dice. Don't think too hard about it, just make their immediate situation more stressful.*
