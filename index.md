Hedge-born is my fantasy heartbreaker roleplaying game. It builds off of the works of Knave by Ben Milton and Cairn by Yochai Gal with rules scavenged from other RPGs (note: cite sources later) and tried through many sessions of play. 

Hedge-born is about adventuring in a perilous and somber world. Players take the mantle of downtrodden characters willing to risk it all for treasure and glory. 

The world of Hedge-born is carved from old stone, it's cracks long formed before any of it's inhabitants were born. When it crumbles beneath their feet, they realize that nothing they ever did could have prevented it, yet generations of their ancestors will live with the consequences.
