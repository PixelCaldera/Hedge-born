# Hedge-born

Hedge-born is my fantasy heartbreaker roleplaying game. It builds off of other OSR works with my own rules tested over many sessions. 

Hedge-born is about adventuring in a perilous and somber world. Players take the mantle of downtrodden characters willing to risk it all for treasure and glory. 

The world of Hedge-born is carved from old stone, it's cracks long formed before any of it's inhabitants were born. When it crumbles beneath their feet, they realize that nothing they ever did could have prevented it, yet generations of their ancestors will live with the consequences.

## Sources and Inspiration

**Knave** by Ben Milton. Provides the baseline of classless D&D with characters based on their inventories.

**Into the Odd** by Chris McDowall. I use the hitless attacks, hit protection (called stamina in this system) and rests.

**Cairn** by Yochai Gal. I have taken inpiration from its blend of Knave and Into the Odd, but diverted in certain places (to do: add more detail on what is different).

**Mausritter** by Isaac Williams. I use the usage dots system.

**Block, Dodge, Parry** by Lars Huijbregts. I use a modification of their weapon traits.

**The Black Hack** by David Black. I use this system's relative time and distance.

**GLOG / Goblin Punch** by Arnold Kemp. I use spells, casting dice, and the underclock found in his blogposts.
