# Equipment Tables

I have 2 goals with the item descriptions in this section.
1. Explain the rules for typical use of the item, especially when it comes to dealing damage and making saves.
2. Explain why characters should bother taking an item with them.

Because characters are so defined by their items in this system, I felt it was important to define the items, and what kind of options they grant a player. I've read many rpgs with large equipment list that don't really explain what any of it is for. Torches, rations, and lockpicks are self-explanotory enough, but most players won't understand that a hammer and spikes can be used to hold a door closed, or that a bell and some twine can be used to make a simple alarm. Part of the fun is discovering these things for yourself, and experimenting with other items, so I've strived to not over-explain.

All alchemy items can be thrown at Nearby targets without penalty, or at Far targets with 1 bane on the effect.

*how should DR to spot things be handled? it's a bit annoying to roll WIL checks, especially for large groups. Come back to this
*If I make "on fire" a condition, I can expand on damage rules and keep them consistent across multiple sources. The downside is you'll have to look elsewhere

## Kits 
Kits are collections of small items that fit in 1 slot. All kits use Quality in place of tracking individual items. If an item in the kit is damaged or can't be reused, mark Quality. Kits can be restocked for 10% of the original cost per Quality dot. 

You may see kits as "quantum inventory" which I'm generally not a fan of, but I use it here to keep small and niche items important without overwhelming players with massive equipment lists and too much burden on their inventory slots. 

If you're unsure on whether or not an item would be inside of a kit, have the player test luck, if they succeed it's in there.

Players can make custom kits. Decide on a theme and select some example items that would be found inside from the other kits, or your own ideas. Items should not be large enough to take a slot and fairly simple in design and function (no magic). Set a price from the average of other similar kits.

|Item|Description|Cost|
|:----------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|-----:|
|Armorer's kit|Whetstone, small hammer, prongs, etc., each Quality dot repairs 1 Quality for weapons or armor|50 sp|
|Climber's kit|Pitons, crampons, block and tackle, etc. |20 sp|
|Cook's kit|Pots and pans, grill, seasonings, etc.|20 sp|
|Firestarter kit*|Flint and steel, tinder, grease, etc.|10 sp|
|Fisher's kit|Line, hooks, bait, etc.|10 sp|
|Healer's kit|Bandages, splints, medicinal herbs, etc., 1 Usage and 1 Action can heal minor physical **Conditions**, 2d4+WIL Stamina in rounds, 2d4+WIL Wounds in turns, or 8+WIL Wounds over a watch|30 sp|
|Trapper's kit|Twine, scissors, small bell, etc. |15 sp|
|Writing kit|Quill, ink pot, parchment, etc.|20 sp|

*Firestarter kits aren't required for lighting easily flammable items like torches or lamp oil. You can assume characters who bought torches also got a small flint and steel to light them, or in a pinch can get a spark from their weapons. Firestarter kits are meant for lighting larger sustained flames on materials that aren't coated in oil like campfires, or wooden structures.
