## Armor Quality

Quality is marked on armor whenever the PC is crit by an attack. When all Quality dots are marked, the next crit gives the armor a -1 AV penalty. AV penalties can be repaired the same as Usage dots, for 10% of the original cost. Once an armor's AV is reduced to 0 it is damaged beyond repair.
