All alchemy items can be thrown at Nearby targets without penalty, or at Far targets with 1 bane on the effect.

*how should DR to spot things be handled? it's a bit annoying to roll WIL checks, especially for large groups. Come back to this
*If I make "on fire" a condition, I can expand on damage rules and keep them consistent across multiple sources. The downside is you'll have to look elsewhere

## Kits 
Kits are collections of small items that fit in 1 slot. All kits use Quality in place of tracking individual items. If an item in the kit is damaged or can't be reused, mark Quality. Kits can be restocked for 10% of the original cost per Quality dot. 

The items listed in each kit are not all-encompassing. Other similar small items may be there if it fits with the theme of the kit. If the Referee is unsure on whether or not an item would be inside of a kit, the player can test luck, if they succeed it's in there and they should make note of it.

Players can make custom kits. Decide on a theme and select some example items that would be found inside from the other kits, or your own ideas. Items should not be large enough to take a slot, and fairly simple in design and function (no magic). Set a price based on other similar kits.

|Item|Description|Cost|
|:----------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|-----:|
|Armorer's kit|Whetstone, small hammer, prongs, etc., each Quality dot repairs 1 Quality for weapons or armor|50 sp|
|Climber's kit|Pitons, crampons, gripping gloves, etc. |20 sp|
|Cook's kit|Pots and pans, grill, seasonings, etc.|20 sp|
|Firestarter kit*|Flint and steel, tinder, grease, etc.|10 sp|
|Fisher's kit|Line, hooks, bait, etc.|10 sp|
|Healer's kit|Bandages, splints, medicinal herbs, etc., 1 Usage and 1 Action can heal minor physical **Conditions**, 2d4+WIL Stamina in rounds, 2d4+WIL Wounds in turns, or 8+WIL Wounds over a watch|30 sp|
|Trapper's kit|Twine, scissors, small bell, etc. |15 sp|
|Writing kit|Quill, ink pot, parchment, etc.|20 sp|

*Firestarter kits aren't required for lighting easily flammable items like torches or lamp oil. You can assume characters who bought torches also got a small flint and steel to light them, or in a pinch can get a spark from their weapons. Firestarter kits are meant for lighting larger sustained flames on materials that aren't coated in oil like campfires, or wooden structures.

*Author's Note: Kits are what you might call "quantum inventory" which I'm generally not a fan of, but I use a restrained version of it here to keep small and niche items important without overwhelming players with massive equipment lists and too much burden on their limited inventory slots.*
