# Items and Inventory
A character's role is determined by the items in their inventory. Preparing your equipment for an adventure and building a fun character are one and the same in this system. Characters are limited only by how much they can carry, and the durability of that gear. 

## Item Slots
- Characters have a number of item slots equal to 10 + STR
- Inventory slots represent the total items your character can carry comfortably while adventuring and assumes they are held in backpacks, belt pouches, etc. 
- Most items take up 1 slot, bulkier items can take up 2 or more
- as a general guide, a slot holds 5 pounds of weight

### What doesn't take up slots?
- Light clothing and jewelry
- Pieces of paper
- Your first 250 coins
  - After that, 1 slot holds 250 coins each
- Other small and light items (ask your referee)
- Corpses, treasure chests, or other large objects
  - If it takes both hands to carry and limits attacking and moving, consider resolving with a STR save. As with any save, if there's no danger involved and the character is physically capable, it only requires time
  - Only use slots for these items when determining how much room they take up in carts or on pack animals

## Quick Slots
- Of a Character's item slots, 2 + DEX are quick slots
- Quick slots represent items easily accessed during combat, and your characters ability to get them quickly
- Any item that isn't in a quick slot requires an action spent retrieving it before it can be used during combat
- Retrieved items don't replace items in quick slots. It remains retrieved until combat ends and it is stored away again
  - Items can not be retrieved pre-emptively to start combat with them ready, quick slots already represent a character's ability to do this
- Outside of combat, you can freely access any item in your inventory, and swap what items are in quick slots
- The item must be entirely in quick slots to gain their benefit. Ex. a sword occupies 2 inventory slots, both of which must be quick slots to be able to draw it without an action in combat
- Armor does not have to be in quick slots to grant it's benefits in combat

## Usage
Usage represents how much of an item is left. Most items have 3 Usage dots. Players will mark a Usage when the item is degraded in some way, such as these situations:
- Rations: mark usage when consumed
- Light Sources: mark usage after 6 turns
- Weapon: mark usage when a 1 is rolled for damage
- Armor: mark usage when hit by a foes crit
- Tools: mark usage when failing a save involving use of that tool
Once all Usage dots are marked, the item is depleted or destroyed.

If an item can be retrieved after use such as arrows or a trap, test luck to see if the item suffered damage, and mark Usage on a failure.

Usage is also used to measure time. A flask of oil that has been set on fire will burn a number of rounds equal to it's remaining usage, the effects of poison last a number of rounds equal to the usage applied. Using Usage to adjudicate other time measurements involving items is encouraged.

### Quality
Quality is used in place of Usage for items that can be repaired, such as weapons and armor. It costs 10% of an items value to repair one Quality dot. 

When all Quality dots are marked, an item has 1 final use. A weapon has one last attack, armor can block 1 more blow, etc. After this, the item is destroyed. Players may opt to not use these items so they can be repaired instead.

## Improvised Items
Players get in all sort of hairy situations and will look to their equipment for solutions. They will try to use items in place of another (ex. some nails as lockpicks, a shovel as a weapon), or test the limits of what an item is physically capable of (ex. catch a goblin in a bug net, break through a wall with a crowbar). When this happens, the Referee can:
- allow it, but mark 1 or more Usage on the item
- allow it, but put 1 or more banes on the save to succeed
- allow it, but it takes a while and something dangerous happens in the meantime
- explain why it won't work, and what they could do to make it work
- any combination of the above
- or, just say no. If items can do too much, it trivializes preparing equipment, and the adventure in general

Overall, be consistent. When players think of solutions, they expect that whatever worked last time will work again. They will get frustrated if things are constantly changing.
