# Spell List

## Spell Parameters

**Targets**:
Target means a creature, object, or point in space within the spell’s range
* A creature is a human, animal, monster, or anything with a stat block
* An object is a distinct item or physical feature. A book or bookshelf is an object, but a library is not. A boulder is an object but a cliff is not. 
  * Large objects generally require stronger spells to be Targeted. If it seems like an object is too large, follow this guide:
    * Power 1: affects up to human-sized objects
    * Power 2: affects up to ogre or wagon sized objects
    * Power 3: affects up to dragon or tavern sized objects

**Duration:**
* If a spell effect seems like it would fade quickly, it does so after [dice] Rounds. 
* This can be modified by the actions of PCs and NPCs (adding fuel to a fire, shouting at someone to wake them, etc.). 
* Most physical things a spell creates should be permanent, but obviously subject to natural degradation. 
  * A stone statue created by a spell shouldn’t just disappear, but will erode over many years. 
  * A storm created by a spell will subside and move with the winds

**Spell Tags:**
* Splittable: each dice can be assigned to a separate target. [sum] then refers to the total of the dice assigned to that target
