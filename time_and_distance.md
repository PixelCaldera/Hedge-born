# Tracking Time
Playing Hedge-born can be broken down into these steps:
1. The Referee describes the situation
2. The Players describe how they interact with the situation
3. The Referee determines if the player’s actions are successful, dice are rolled if necessary, and the Referee describes the results.

This structure repeats as the game continues. 

While interacting, Player Characters (PCs) can Move and perform one Action, before moving on to what the next Player would like to do. 

The steps above are tracked depending on the urgency of the situation using these time scales:

**Rounds**
- When every second counts
- 1 Round is about 6 seconds
- Used during Combat, chases, and complex traps
  
**Turns**
- Danger could be around the corner
- 1 Turn is about 10 minutes
- Used during dungeon crawling
  
**Watches**
- Long periods without incident
- 1 Watch is 4 hours, 6 Watches/day
- Used during travel, and exploring hexes and settlements

Actions. items, and spells will reference these time scales to describe how long they takes to use. If no time scale is referenced, assume it can be done in a Round.

## Distance
To measure the positions and movement of characters and objects in the world, four range bands are used. From nearest to farthest:

Close → Nearby → Far → Distant

Zones are used to describe areas. Everything inside a Zone is Close to each other, things in the next Zone over are Nearby, things two Zones over are Far, etc. 

### Movement
On a Turn, a PC can move somewhere Nearby
If a PC is Nearby something and decides to move towards it, they are now Close to it
Moving shifts you one step along the range band
Enhanced movement shifts you two steps along the range band
Move somewhere Far in 1 Turn
Hindered movement shifts only half a step along the range band
Moving somewhere Nearby takes 2 Turns
Interaction
If a PC is Close to something, that means they are able to physically interact with it
Ex. picking up an object, attacking a creature with a melee weapon
Ranged weapons, Items, and Spells have specified ranges that determine their interaction distance
